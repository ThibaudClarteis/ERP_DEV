# ERP_DEV
Hello Team, 
Here is a code to add in ERPNext. 
I would like to compare each purchase delivery expected date with the purchase receipt date.
And then make a date diff to see if the delivery was on time, or late
And then, if it was late, say that the delivery time was not conform.
The same for the product complience, if delivery has been complete, means delivery is conform, if not delivery is not conform.
Thank you for the support.
